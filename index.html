        <h2>Story of us</h2>
        <p>
          I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
          How we met and the sparks flew instantly
          People would say, "they're the lucky ones"
          I used to know my place was a spot next to you
          Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
          'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
          Oh, a simple complication
          Miscommunications lead to fall out
          So many things that I wish you knew
          So many walls up I can't break through
          Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
          And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
          Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
          I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
          When it all broke down and the story of us
          Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter
